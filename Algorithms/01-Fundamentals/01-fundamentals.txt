1) Setting and Swapping
Set myNumber to 42. Set myName to your name. Now swap myNumber into myName & vice versa.

2) Print and Count
Print all integer multiples of 5, from 512 to 4096. Afterward, also print how many there were.

3) Print -52 to 1066
Print integers from -52 to 1066 using a FOR loop.

4) Multiples of Six
Print multiples of 6 up to 60,000, using a WHILE.

5) Don’t Worry, Be Happy
Create beCheerful(). Within it, console.log string "good morning!" Call it 98 times.

6) Counting, the Dojo Way
Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If by 10, also print "Dojo".

7) Multiples of Three – but Not All
Using FOR, print multiples of 3 from -300 to 0. Skip -3 and -6.

8) What Do You Know?
Your function will be given an input parameter incoming. Please console.log this value.

9) Printing Integers with While
Print integers from 2000 to 5280, using a WHILE.

10) Whoa, That Sucker’s Huge...
Add odd integers from -300,000 to 300,000, and console.log the final sum. Is there a shortcut?

11) You Say It’s Your Birthday
If 2 given numbers represent your birth month and day in either order, log "How did you know", else log "Just another day...."

12) Countdown by Fours
Log positive numbers starting at 2016, counting down by fours (exclude 0), without a FOR loop.

13) Leap Year
Write a function that determines whether a given year is a leap year. If a year is divisible by four, it is a leap year, unless it is divisible by 100. However, if it is divisible by 400, then it is.

14) Flexible Countdown
Based on earlier “Countdown by Fours”, given lowNum, highNum, mult, print multiples of mult from highNum down to lowNum, using a FOR. For (2,9,3), print 9 6 3 (on successive lines).

15) The Final Countdown
This is based on “Flexible Countdown”. The parameter names are not as helpful, but the problem is essentially identical; don’t be thrown off! Given 4 parameters (param1,param2,param3,param4), print the multiples of param1, starting at param2 and extending to param3. One exception: if a multiple is equal to param4, then skip (don’t print) it. Do this using a WHILE. Given (3,5,17,9), print 6,12,15 (which are all of the multiples of 3 between 5 and 17, and excluding the value 9).
