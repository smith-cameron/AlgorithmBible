1 - Biggie Size
Given an array, write a function that changes all positive numbers in the array to “big”. Example: makeItBig([-1,3,5,-5]) returns that same array, changed to [-1,"big","big",-5].

2 - Previous Lengths
You are passed an array containing strings. Working within that same array, replace each string with a number – the length of the string at previous array index – and return the array.

3 - Print Low, Return High
Create a function that takes array of numbers. The function should print the lowest value in the array, and return the highest value in the array.

4 - Add Seven to Most
Build function that accepts array. Return a new array with all values except first, adding 7 to each. Do not alter the original array.

5 - Print One, Return Another
Build a function that takes array of numbers. The function should print second-to-last value in the array, and return first odd value in the array.

6 - Reverse Array
Given array, write a function to reverse values, in-place. Example: reverse([3,1,6,4,2]) returns same array, containing [2,4,6,1,3].

7 - Double Vision
Given array, create a function to return a new array where each value in the original has been doubled. Calling double([1,2,3]) should return [2,4,6] without changing original.

8 - Outlook: Negative
Given an array, create and return a new one containing all the values of the provided array, made negative (not simply multiplied by -1). Given [1,-3,5], return [-1,-3,-5].

9 - Count Positives
Given array of numbers, create function to replace last value with number of positive values. Example, countPositives([-1,1,1,1]) changes array to [-1,1,1,3] and returns it.

10 - Always Hungry
Create a function that accepts an array, and prints "yummy" each time one of the values is equal to "food". If no array elements are "food", then print "I'm hungry" once.

11 - Evens and Odds
Create a function that accepts an array. Every time that array has three odd values in a row, print "That’s odd!" Every time the array has three evens in a row, print "Even more so!"

12 - Swap Toward the Center
Given array, swap first and last, third and third-to- last, etc. Input[true,42,"Ada",2,"pizza"] becomes ["pizza",42,"Ada",2,true]. Change [1,2,3,4,5,6] to [6,2,4,3,5,1].

13 - Increment the Seconds
Given arr, add 1 to odd elements ([1], [3],
etc.), console.log all values and return arr.

14 - Scale the Array
Given array arr and number num, multiply each arr value by num, and return the changed arr.
