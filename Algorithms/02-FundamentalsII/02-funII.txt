1 - Modulo Operator
So far you have learned about basic arithmetic operators to add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*) and divide (/). You may also have realized that JavaScript uses the + operator to concatenate strings as well! Now we want to introduce you to another operator, called modulo (%). Modulo is a companion operator to divide – think of it as “remainder”. Given two numbers, modulo divides the second number into the first number an integer number of times, and returns the remainder. Examples: (34 % 6) is 4 because 34 integer-divides into 6 five times (30), leaving a remainder of 4. Modulo is great for determining if a number is even/odd: (16 % 2) is 0: it is even. Is 42 a multiple of ten? (42 % 10) is 2: no, it is not.

2.1 - Threes and Fives
Create threesFives() that adds values from 100 to 4000000 (inclusive) if that value is evenly divisible by 3 or 5 but not both. Display the final sum in the console.
    2.2: Create betterThreesFives(start,end) that allows you to enter arbitrary start and end values for your range. Think of threesFives()as betterThreesFives(100,4000000).

3.1 - Generate Coin Change
Change is inevitable (especially when breaking a twenty). Make generateCoinChange(cents). Accept a number of American cents, compute and print how to represent that amount with smallest number of coins. Common American coins are pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), and quarters (25 cents).
    3.2: can you simplify/shorten your code?
    3.3: add half-dollar (50 cents) and dollar (100 cents) coins with 40 additional characters or less.
        Example output, given (94):
        94 cents can be represented by:
        quarters: 3
        dimes: 1
        nickels: 1
        pennies: 4

4 - Messy Math Mashup
Create a function messyMath(num) that will return the following sum: add all integers from 0 up to the given num, except for the following special cases of our count value:
    1. If current count (not num) is evenly divisible by 3, don’t add to sum; skip to the next count;
    2. Otherwise, if current count is evenly divisible by 7, include it twice in sum instead of once;
    3. Regardless of the above, if current count is exactly 1/3 of num, return -1 immediately.
For example, if given num is 4, return 7. If given num is 8, return 34. If given num is 15, return -1.


5 - Twelve-Bar Blues
Write a function that console.logs the number 1, then "chick", then "boom", then "chick", then 2, then "chick", "boom", "chick" – continuing the same cycle for each number up to (including) 12.

6 - Fibonacci
Create a function to generate Fibonacci numbers. In this famous mathematical sequence, each number is the sum of the previous two, starting with values 0 and 1. Your function should accept one argument, an index into the sequence (where 0 corresponds to the initial value, 4 corresponds to the value four later, etc). Examples: fibonacci(0) = 0 (given), fibonacci(1) = 1 (given), fibonacci(2) = 1 (fib(0)+fib(1), or 0+1), fibonacci(3) = 2 (fib(1)+fib(2), or 1+1), fibonacci(4) = 3 (1+2), fibonacci(5) = 5 (2+3), fibonacci(6) = 8 (3+5), fibonacci(7) = 13 (5+8), etc.

7 - Sum to One Digit
Kaitlin sees beauty in numbers, but also believes that less is more. Implement sumToOne(num) that sums a given integer’s digits repeatedly until the sum is only one digit. Return that one-digit result. Example: sumToOne(928) returns 1, because 9+2+8 = 19, then 1+9 = 10, then 1+0 = 1.

8 - Clock Hand Angles
Regardless of how hard a Dojo student works (and they should work hard), they need time now and then to unwind – like hands on a clock. Traditional clocks are increasingly uncommon, but most can still read an analog clock’s hands of hours, minutes and seconds. Create clockHandAngles(seconds) that, given a number of seconds since 12:00:00, prints angles (in degrees) of the hour, minute and second hands. As review, 360 degrees form a full rotation. For input of 3600 secs (equivalent to 1:00:00), print "Hour hand: 30 degs. Minute hand: 0 degs. Second hand: 0 degs." For an input parameter seconds of 119730 (which is equivalent to 9:15:30 plus 24 hours!), you should log "Hour hand: 277.745 degs. Minute hand: 93 degs. Second hand: 180 degs." Note: in the second example, the angle for the minute hand is not simply 90 degrees; it has advanced a bit further, because of the additional 30 seconds in that minute so far.
    Second: also calculate and print degrees for an additional “week hand” that rotates once each week

9 - Is Prime
Return whether a given integer is prime. Prime numbers are only evenly divisible by themselves and 1. Many highly optimized solutions exist, but for now just create one that is easy to understand and debug.

10 - Rockin’ the Dojo Sweatshirt
Ever since you arrived at the Dojo, you wanted one of those cool Coding Dojo sweatshirts – maybe even more than one. Let’s say they cost $20 (including tax), but friendly Josh gives a 9% discount if you buy two, a nice 19% discount if you buy three, or a sweet 35% discount if you buy four or more. He only accepts cash and says he doesn’t have coins, so you should round up to the nearest dollar. Build function sweatshirtPricing(num) that, given a number of sweatshirts, returns the cost.

11 - Clock Hand Angles, Revisited
Return to your previous clockHandAngles solution. Allow fractional values for input seconds, but
change your implementation to print only integer values for angles (in degrees) of the various hands.
