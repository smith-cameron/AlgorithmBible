 Recursive Binary Search
Given a sorted array and a value, recursively determine whether value is found within array. 
rBinarySearch([1,3,5,6],4) = false; rBinarySearch([4,5,6,8,12],5) = true. 
 Greatest Common Factor
Given two integers, create rGCF(num1,num2) to recursively determine Greatest Common Factor (the 
largest integer dividing evenly into both). Greek mathematician Euclid demonstrated these facts:
1) gcf(a,b) == a, if a == b;
2) gcf(a,b) == gcf(a-b,b), if a>b;
3) gcf(a,b) == gcf(a,b-a), if b>a. 
Second: rework facts #2 and #3 to reduce stack 
consumption and expand rGCF’s reach. You should
be able to compute rGCF(123456,987654). 
 Tarai
The tarai (Japanese: “to pass around”) function was created to profile recursive performance in 
various systems and languages. Unlike other functions, numbers don't get particularly large, but the 
amount of recursion is significant. The tarai function accepts three parameters, and is defined as:
1) tarai(x,y,z) == y, if x <= y (otherwise see rule #2); 
2) tarai(x,y,z) == tarai(tarai(x-1,y,z),tarai(y-1,z,x),tarai(z-1,x,y)). 
Calling tarai(10,2,9) should return 9 (after recursing 4145 times!). 
 String: In-Order Subsets
Create strSubsets(str). Return an array with every possible in-order character subset of str. The 
resultant array itself need not be in any specific order – it is the subset of letters in each string that must
be in the same order as they were in the original string. Given "abc", return an array that includes 
["", "c", "b", "bc", "a", "ac", "ab", "abc"] (in any order).

 Recursive List Length
Given first node of a singly linked list, create a recursive function that returns number of nodes in that
list. Assume list contains no loops and is short enough that you will not ‘blow your stack’. 
 Got Any Grapes?!?
Martin loves grapes. He sees a number of baggies containing grapes, all in a row. Stephen tells him 
that he can take as many of the baggies as he wants, as long as he doesn’t take two that are next to 
each other. Martin wants to maximize his number of grapes. Grapes are pretty healthy, so let’s help him 
out. Create a function to accept an array of non-negative integers representing number of grapes in 
each adjacent baggy. Your function should return the maximum number of grapes he can obtain. 
 Collatz-apalooza
Define a function that, given positive integer num, returns num/2 if num is even or 3*num + 1 if num is 
odd. Continuously feeding result back into function results in numerical series such as 5,16,8,4,2,1. 
According to Dr. Lothar Collatz, the series always reaches 1 (and then repeats 4,2,1,4,2,1,…).
What starting number requires the most iterations before reaching 1 the first time? 
 Telephone Words
Nikki has a new phone number (304-5083) and wants to create a clever way for everyone to remember 
it. On older telephones, the keypad associates letters with each numeral. Given a seven-digit telephone 
number, return an array of all possible strings that equate to that phone number. For reference, here is 
the mapping: [2:ABC; 3:DEF; 4:GHI; 5:JKL; 6:MNO; 7:PQRS; 8:TUV; 9:WXYZ] – for 
completeness, map 1 to I and zero to O. For example, given a phone number 818-2612, return an 
array of 243 different strings, including “vitamic” and “titania”.
