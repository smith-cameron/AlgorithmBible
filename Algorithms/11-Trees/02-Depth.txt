 BST: Height
Build a height() method on the BST object that 
returns the total height of the tree – the longest
sequence of nodes from root node to leaf node.
 BST: Is Balanced
Write isbalanced()method to indicate whether 
a BST is balanced. For this challenge, consider a 
tree balanced when all nodes are balanced. A 
BTNode is balanced if heights of its left subtree 
and right subtree differ by at most one. 
 Array to BST
Given an array that is sorted in ascending order, return a BST object that is height-balanced. 
 Closest Common Ancestor
Given a BST and two contained values, return the value of the closest common ancestor node. For 
each node, the chain up to root (including self) represents that node’s ancestry. Return the value of
the node in both ancestor chains that is closest to both.
