 Multikey Sort 
For this challenge, you will sort an array, however the items in the array are not simple numbers. Given 
an array of objects, where each object contains a .firstName and a .lastName, sort the array by
both last name (primary) and first name (secondary). Lee Abbey should be sorted before Aaron 
Carnevale, and Aaron Carnevale should be sorted before his brother Giorgio Carnevale.
