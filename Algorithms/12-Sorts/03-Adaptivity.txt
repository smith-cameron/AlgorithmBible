 SList: Merge Sort
Use combineLists(list1,list2) to build the
mergeSortList(list) algorithm for an unsorted 
singly linked list. What are run-time and space
complexities of your solution?
 Array: Partition
Partition unsorted array in-place. Use arr[0] as
pivot val; return idx of pivot. Input [5,4,9,2,5,3]
becomes [4,2,3,5,9,5], return 4. 
Second: for pivot, use median of first, last, mid. 
Third: partition a subset, given start and end. 
Exclude end; default values are 0 and arr.length.
 SList: Partition
Partition a singly linked list. Use first element 
as pivot; return the new list. List nodes contain 
.val and .next; do not reference other 
attributes. For example, if you are given the
following linked list: { 
5=>1=>8=>4=>9=>2=>5=>3 }, you should 
return: { 1=>4=>2=>3=>5=>8=>9=>5 }.
