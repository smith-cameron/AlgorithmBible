 BST: Values for Layer
Jeff has divided his workgroup into a perfectly balanced hierarchy, to the extent that his organizational 
chart looks just like a binary tree! To learn how things are going “in the trenches”, he wants to have a
meeting with all the line managers, but not include their bosses. Given a BST and a layer number
(starting at zero for the root), return an array containing all the values at that layer in the BST. If a BST
is a full tree, what percentage of nodes are leaves? What percentage are ‘first-level managers’?
 BST: Layer Arrays
Given a BST, return a two-dimensional array containing all values in the BST. The outer array
represents each layer (starting at zero for the root), and the inner array for each layer represents the 
values at that layer in the BST.
