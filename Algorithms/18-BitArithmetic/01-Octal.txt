Octal System
There is a number system called ‘octal’ that uses 8 numerals, grouping three bits together into one
numeral that goes from 0 to 7. After counting up to 7, we start using an additional digit, just like in our 
usual decimal system we start using the “tens” digit when counting beyond 9. The indicator that we are 
using octal is the prefix ‘0o’, so the number 8 (decimal) will appear in octal as 0o10. In decimal notation, 
each numeral has a jump in value of 10x as we move from the ‘ones’ digit to the ‘tens’ digit, or from the
‘tens’ digit to the ‘hundreds’ digit. Similarly, in octal each digit represents a jump of 8x. A number like 
0o4213, then, is (4 x 8
3
) + (2 x 82
) + (1 x 81
) + (3 x 80
) = 2187 (decimal). You won’t need to deal with
octal numbers much – if anything, you will deal with either base-2 or base-16 – but it gives a good
introduction to the idea that computers don’t have ten fingers and hence don’t agree with our 
completely arbitrary decision to think about numbers as having exactly 10 numerals. 
 Decimal to Octal Practice
For practice, convert the following from decimal to octal representation. Example: 31 becomes 0o37.
13 6 25 8 45 10 -9 64 255
 Octal to Decimal Practice
For practice, convert the following from octal to decimal. Example: 0o47 becomes 39. 
0o610 0o5 0o26 0o47 0o302 0o0 -0o12 0o76 0o101
 Decimal to Octal String
Create a function dec2OctStr(value) that converts a number into a string representing that number 
in octal notation. For this challenge, do not use the (very convenient) toString function.
 Octal String to Value
Create a function octStr2Val(str) that accepts a string representing an integer in octal notation,
and returns the value. For this challenge, do not use the (very convenient) parseInt function.
