 Closest Three-Sum (Series)
Given an assorted array of numbers, plus a target number, return the three array elements whose 
sum is closest to target. For example, given ([1,8,5,10,2,4,3],6), return [1,2,3]


 Is Number Prime (Series)
Given number, return whether it is prime. 
Prime numbers are only evenly divisible
by themselves and 1.
Before moving on, quickly write a naïve 
isNumberPrime, and then optimize it.
 Counting Primes
Build on the isNumberPrime(num) function at left to 
count the primes that are equal or less than given integer. 
Second: add the ability to profile this function, measuring 
progress as we optimize isNumberPrime.
