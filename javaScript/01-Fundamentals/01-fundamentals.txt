1 - Set myNumber to 42. Set myName to your name.
2 - Now swap myNumber into myName & vice versa.
3 - Print integers from -52 to 1066 using a FOR loop.
4 - Print all integer multiples of 5, from 512 to 4096. Afterward, also log how many there were.
5 - Print multiples of 6 up to 60,000, using a WHILE
6 - Create beCheerful(). Within it, console.log string "good morning!" Call it 98 times.
7 - Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If by 10, also print " Dojo".
8 - Using FOR, print multiples of 3 from -300 to 0. Skip -3 and -6.
9 - Your function will be given an input parameter incoming. Please console.log this value.
10 - Print integers from 2000 to 5280, using a WHILE.
11 - Add odd integers from -300,000 to 300,000, and console.log the final sum. Is there a shortcut?
12 - If 2 given numbers represent your birth month and day in either order, log "How did you know?", else log "Just another day...."
13 - Log positive numbers starting at 2016, counting down by fours (exclude 0), without a FOR loop.
14 - Based on earlier fourDown(), given lowNum, highNum, mult, print multiples of mult from highNum down to lowNum, using a FOR. For (2,9,3), print 9 6 3 (on successive lines).
15 - Write a function that determines whether a given year is a leap year. If a year is divisible by four, it is a leap year, unless it is divisible by 100. However, if it is divisible by 400, then it is.
16 - This is based on “Flexible Countdown”. The parameter names are not as helpful, but the problem is essentially identical; don’t be thrown off! Given 4 parameters (param1,param2,param3,param4), print the multiples of param1, starting at param2 and extending to param3. One exception: if a multiple is equal to param4, then skip (don’t print) it. Do this using a WHILE. Given (3,5,17,9), print 6,12,15 (which are all of the multiples of 3 between 5 and 17, and excluding the value 9).
