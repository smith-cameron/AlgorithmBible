1 - String.concat
String.concat(str2,str3,...,strX) - add string(s) to end of existing one. Return new string.

2 - String.slice
String.slice(start,end) - extract part of a string and return in a new one. Start and end are indices into the string, with the first character at index 0. End param is optional and if present, refers to one beyond the last character to include.
    Bonus: include support for negative indices, representing offsets from string-end. Example: String.slice(-1) returns the stringâ€™s last character.

3 - String.trim
String.trim() - remove whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) from both sides, and return a new
string. Example: " \n hello goodbye \t ".trim() should return "hello goodbye".

4 - String.split
String.split(separator,limit) - split string into an array of substrings, returning array. Separator specifies where to divide substrings and is not included in any substring. If "" is specified, split the string on every character. Limit is optional and indicates number of splits; additional post-limit items should be discarded. Note: existing string is unaffected.

5 - String.search
String.search(val) - search string for the given val (another string). Return the index position
of the first match found (or -1 if not found).
